   1 # Getting Started with 'vsperf'
   2 
   3 ## Hardware Requirements
   4 VSPERF requires the following hardware to run tests: IXIA traffic generator (IxNetwork), a machine that runs the IXIA client software and a CentOS Linux release 7.1.1503 (Core) host.
   5 
   6 ## Installation
   7 
   8 Follow the [installation instructions] to install.
   9 
  10 ## IXIA Setup
  11 ###On the CentOS 7 system
  12 You need to install IxNetworkTclClient$(VER_NUM)Linux.bin.tgz.
  13 
  14 ### On the IXIA client software system
  15 Find the IxNetwork TCL server app (start -> All Programs -> IXIA -> IxNetwork -> IxNetwork_$(VER_NUM) -> IxNetwork TCL Server)
  16   - Right click on IxNetwork TCL Server, select properties
  17   - Under shortcut tab in the Target dialogue box make sure there is the argument "-tclport xxxx" where xxxx is your port number (take note of this port number you will need it for the 10_custom.conf file).
  18   ![Alt text](TCLServerProperties.png)
  19   - Hit Ok and start the TCL server application
  20 
  21 ## Cloning and building src dependencies
  22 In order to run VSPERF, you will need to download DPDK and OVS. You can do this manually and build them in a preferred location, or you could use vswitchperf/src. The vswitchperf/src directory contains makefiles that will allow you to clone and build the libraries that VSPERF depends on, such as DPDK and OVS. To clone and build simply:
  23 
  24 ```bash
  25 cd src
  26 make
  27 ```
  28 
  29 To delete a src subdirectory and its contents to allow you to re-clone simply use:
  30 
  31 ```bash
  32 make cleanse
  33 ```
  34 
  35 ## Configure the `./conf/10_custom.conf` file
  36 
  37 The supplied `10_custom.conf` file must be modified, as it contains configuration items for which there are no reasonable default values.
  38 
  39 The configuration items that can be added is not limited to the initial contents. Any configuration item mentioned in any .conf file in `./conf` directory can be added and that item will be overridden by the custom
  40 configuration value.
  41 
  42 ## Using a custom settings file
  43 
  44 Alternatively a custom settings file can be passed to `vsperf` via the `--conf-file` argument.
  45 
  46 ```bash
  47 ./vsperf --conf-file <path_to_settings_py> ...
  48 ```
  49 
  50 Note that configuration passed in via the environment (`--load-env`) or via another command line argument will override both the default and your custom configuration files. This "priority hierarchy" can be described like so (1 = max priority):
  51 
  52 1. Command line arguments
  53 2. Environment variables
  54 3. Configuration file(s)
  55

  58 ## Executing tests
  59 Before running any tests make sure you have root permissions by adding the following line to /etc/sudoers:
  60 ```
  61 username ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
  62 ```
  63 username in the example above should be replaced with a real username.
  64 
  65 To list the available tests:
  66 
  67 ```bash
  68 ./vsperf --list-tests
  69 ```
  70 
  71 To run a group of tests, for example all tests with a name containing
  72 'RFC2544':
  73 
  74 ```bash
  75 ./vsperf --conf-file=user_settings.py --tests="RFC2544"
  76 ```
  77 
  78 To run all tests:
  79 
  80 ```bash
  81 ./vsperf --conf-file=user_settings.py
  82 ```
  83 
  84 Some tests allow for configurable parameters, including test duration (in
  85 seconds) as well as packet sizes (in bytes).
  86 
  87 ```bash
  88 ./vsperf --conf-file user_settings.py
  89     --tests RFC2544Tput
  90     --test-param "rfc2544_duration=10;packet_sizes=128"
  91 ```
  92 
  93 For all available options, check out the help dialog:
  94 
  95 ```bash
  96 ./vsperf --help
  97 ```
